# PSA_TU_Custom_ECU

This project aims to create documentation and a custom PCB based on the **Seepduino** project, to develop a **plug-and-play (PnP) ECU** for the **PSA TU engine family**.

The goal is to offer an affordable and open hardware solution tailored for enthusiasts, tuners, and developers working with Peugeot and Citroën TU-series engines.

## Development Status

Currently, development is focused on the **TU5J** engine, as I am working with a Peugeot 306 featuring the **TU5J (1.6L 8V)** engine.

I'm also planning to swap in a **TU5JP4 (1.6L 16V)**, which is known for better airflow and higher performance potential. This makes it a more capable base for tuning and further ECU development.
